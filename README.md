# SWN-Trade-Lord
SWN Trade Helper
### Install
Can be installed with this manifest: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Frosthawk617/SWN-Trade-Lord/main/module.json
### Functionality
Step 1: Create some tags in the modules configuration menu.\
Step 2: Create some worlds using those tags. All fields must be filled and for positive numbers do not add the +.\
Step 3: Create some trade goods. The tags section should be filled like this [Compact, Illegal, Military] without the brackets.\

Once those steps are done you can open up a ships actor sheet and you will see a trade button at the top of the sheet next to options. When buying you will be able to select any of the trade goods you have created. When selling you will only see what is in your cargo.
Automation: Right now it automates cargo space, credit payment from the ship's pool, and it also rolls for negotiation automatically.
